        <p>Every gemstones is unique and precious. Some people admire them for their design, colour, shine, glitter and lustre while others associate them with healing energies. Cleaning and polishing gemstones is a complicated industrial process as part of many stages a gemstone undergoes after being mined as deep as fifty-five miles in the earths crust. For this reason the most studied gemstones are green Peridots and Diamonds. Diamonds are commonly recognised as being colourless, although some do have colour. Some basic day to day cleaning methods include the use of simple soap and water or baking soda mixed with water into a paste and using a soft brush to scrub gently before drying and polishing them with a lint-free cloth. A slightly high end method involves using 2-3 tablespoons of Aluminium oxide chemical compound polish mixed in water and vinegar. The vinegar particularly helps in dealing with scratches. These methods work well with paintbrushes which are suitable for wet paints but even toothbrushes do a fine job. Some methods may suit some gemstones better than others. Recommended for a Garnet gemstone is a gentle hand soap mixed in warm water. On the other hand a Sapphire gemstone may work well with a gentle dishwasher soap mixed in a solution of ammonia gas. Ammonia is prevalent in nature and also the human body (thus makes you wonder why people breath on their reading glasses before wiping them with a cloth to make them clean and shiny). A bristle brush is recommended in order to reach all parts of a Sapphire.</p>
